Experiment 1: Implementation of Data Charts using R
1.Overview

This experiment focuses on using R programming to visualize academic performance data through different types of charts.
The goal is to analyze student assessment data and gain insights into subject-wise performance, performance trends, and grade distribution.

 2.Objective
To design and implement appropriate data charts for analyzing and comparing academic performance indicators using R.


3. Scenario
An academic institution analyzes internal assessment marks of students across multiple subjects to:

Identify difficult subjects

Understand performance trends

Support data-driven academic decisions

4. Dataset Description

The dataset (student_performance.csv) contains:

Student ID
Department
Semester
Subject
Internal Test 1 marks
Internal Test 2 marks
Assignment marks
Attendance percentage
Final grade

5. Tools & Technologies
Language: R
Libraries Used:
ggplot2 – Data visualization
dplyr – Data preprocessing and aggregation
Platform: RStudio 

6.Visualizations Implemented

Bar Chart
Displays subject-wise average marks
Helps identify subjects with low performance
Line Chart
Shows performance trend across tests
Useful for trend analysis
Pie Chart
Represents grade distribution
Gives an overview of student performance levels

7. How to Run
Clone the repository
Open the R script in RStudio or Google Colab
Place student_performance.csv in the working directory
Install required libraries
Run the script to generate charts

8. Learning Outcomes
Understanding of basic data preprocessing in R
Practical use of ggplot2 for visualization

Ability to analyze academic performance using charts

Experience with real-world educational data
